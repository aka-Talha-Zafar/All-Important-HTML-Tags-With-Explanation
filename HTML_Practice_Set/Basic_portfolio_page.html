            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>
                Meet <strong>"Talha" a computer science student</strong> powered by caffeine, curiosity, and a borderline unhealthy obsession with clean code and mobile apps. He's the kind of person who dual-boots Windows and Ubuntu just because he can, and then wonders why Ubuntu doesn't love his touchscreen back. With dreams taller than his GitHub contribution graph and a Surface Laptop that’s seen more experiments than a chemistry lab.
            </p>
            <p>
                Talha is grinding through the world of React Native, slowly cloning Facebook one pixel at a time. He's got startup ideas, AI chatbot prototypes, and a growing collection of repositories titled things like “Beginner’s Guide to Git” and “Why CSS Is My Nemesis.” Whether he's breaking down cloud architecture or debugging why router.back() is ghosting him, Talha does it all with professional ambition, a touch of sarcasm, and a head full of questions like “What if this app could actually diagnose your cold?” Don’t be fooled—behind that humble syntax lies a developer with real hustle, two free years to conquer the dev world, and just enough skepticism to keep tech trends in check.

            <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
            <p>
                I don’t really have anything you’d call a “hobby.” If sleeping was a skill, I’d be a professional by now. <strong>And if dreaming counted as productivity—whether with eyes open or closed—I’d already be a billionaire.</strong> My favorite thing to do in my free time? Manifestation. Yup, just sitting there, visualizing success while ignoring all the actual work I should be doing.<strong> Honestly, I struggle to complete the tasks I’m assigned—so who has time for hobbies anyway?</strong>

            <h2>Skills:</h2>
            <p>
                When it comes to skills, <strong>all I really know is how to mess around and make random noise—nothing else,</strong> to be honest. <strong>I am basically a self declared expert.</strong>

            <h2>Message for Readers:</h2>
            <p>
                It doesn’t feel right saying this, but I still want to share it—one of my legs is artificial. I have a big desire to earn lots of money, but I can’t actually make any. If you want, you can help me fulfill this dream by sending me your spare change.
                <br>
                <strong>Will be waiting for it desperately!</strong>
